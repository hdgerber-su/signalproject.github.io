Individual Project Idea

For my individual project, the website I will design will be on the Signal Corps. I am currently in Army ROTC and I will be commissioning in May as an Army Signal Officer. The Signal corps is a military branch of the Army that is in charge of communications. This topic is worth making a website about, because it is one of the oldest branches of the armed forces and is very important for the success of our military. The Signal corps plays a very active role in the everyday processes of the Army. I plan on having my homepage be a page full of pictures and maybe even a video of cool Signal operations. I will use the Signal colors, which are orange and white and sometimes bronze, for fonts and borders. I will have a second page dedicated to the history of Signal. This page will have old and new photos, and hopefully buttons with links to more information on the topic. Then I will have a third page with the skills that make up a Signal soldier. This page I hope to have a cool arrangement of pictures and diagrams to have an exciting way to view this information. Lastly, I hope to have a page where there will be recruitment and contact information for people interested in joining the Signal corps. I hope that other pages will lead to this final page, making the website more interactive.
